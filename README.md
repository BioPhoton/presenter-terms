# Presenter terms: Christian Heilmann

I have defined presenter terms. In addition to the ones here, please refer to the [So you want me to talk?](https://christianheilmann.com/2012/04/25/so-you-want-me-to-talk/) article on my blog. I am a professional presenter with lots of experience. Therefore I want to make sure that there is no misconception about what I expect and deliver.

I know it is hard to organise events, so I want to make sure that we are on the same level. Here is a list of things that I will not do. 

* :x: I will not present at a panel or a conference line-up with an obvious lack of diversity. Our audience comes in all shapes and sizes, so should the experts on stage
* :x: I expect the conference to have an enforced code of conduct 
* :x: I don't "pay to play". As a presenter, I expect full access to the event.
* :x: I don't deal with sponsorships of the event and I am not interested in sponsored speaking slots. 
* :x: I have a list of people I will not present alongside and I refuse to present at events that have certain sponsors. I will flag that up to you when that is the case. I am sorry, that this is the case, but it helps.

## :pencil: Presenter Bio

> Chris Heilmann dedicated the last 20 years of his life to make the web work and thrive. As a lead developer on some of the largest web products he learned that knowledge is not enough without teamwork and good handover. He dedicated most of his time since on educating, writing and sharing, presenting on average at 30 conferences a year. He strives to make code and coders work efficiently. He is the author of several JavaScript books and the Developer Evangelism handbook (http://developer-evangelism.com). He is currently a Senior Program Manager in Microsoft and spends a lot of time pondering how machine learning and AI can aid humans and replace jobs we're too important to do. 

### My deliveries

- [x] **Deliver a fitting talk for the intended audience.** I am happy to discuss content with you but I only will not send slides for review and change by conference organisers. I tend to deliver a unique talk every time I can and it will be an up-to-date talk. This can not be achieved if I need to send in the deck weeks in advance. Slides to me are wallpaper of a presentation and I treat them as such. 
- [x] **Deliver the talk on time and sticking to the defined format and duration.** I need to know what time frame you expect and what format you want it to be in. I will show up at the times you need me to be there and set up on stage with enough time for AV people to wire up microphones and other equipment. I tend not to need any dry-run or setup, but I am happy to do so if that is your conference policy. 
- [x] **Use my own computer to deliver my talk.** Many times I will go beyond slide decks and show live code and examples. My setup is a Surface Pro or Macbook and I will bring my own dongle and remote control. 
Attend your event to mingle with attendees. I do speak because I want people to learn something. Therefore I will take part in your conference to be able to answer people's questions before and after my presentation or workshop. I consider parachuting in and out of conferences and only mingling with other speakers a waste and unprofessional demeanor for a conference presenter. We're not rockstars or actors who deliver a concert or play and leave. That said, I can't always be there for the whole conference, especially for multi-day events. I'd appreciate a schedule where you really need me to be there. 
- [x] **Promote my presence at your event.** I will tweet and blog before, during and after the event about what I will do at your event and interesting things I encounter. 
- [x] **Publish my slides and screen recording after my talk.** If there is a good enough connection, this normally happens right after the presentation. Everything I create at your event will be licensed Creative Commons unless otherwise agreed. 

### My expectations


### Expenses and payment 


- [] Provide me with a prime speaking slot. I've proven to be a good keynote speaker and find interesting topics to open or close conferences. I also work well as a moderator or on-stage interviewer. I don't feel I am used to the best of my abilities for your event when I speak to a half-empty room in a side track. I am happy to promote and remind people of side-track activities though. 
- [] Deliver a professional stage setup. I bring my own laptop and connectors, but I expect at least a power plug and a microphone. I am very good with audio engineers (having been one myself) but I am not there to fix audio issues or set up projectors. I expect this to work and be available. I normally don't need an internet connection, but would love to have one. 
- [] Record and publish my talk. As each of my talks are unique there is no danger that people can attend one they already have seen on the web. Recordings are a great advertisement for your conference. 
- [] If possible, I'd like you to cover my travel and hotel. I am on stage and need to be able to concentrate on that. I can not do so if I need to find lodgings and organise travel to your event in addition to presenting. I don't expect first class or business class flights, but I do expect to arrive a day before the event and leave the day after with lodging organised in between. I do not want to book and pay myself and get reimbursed. International payments are a mess and I don't have time to deal with paper work in between events seeing that I am presenting almost every two weeks. I am sorry if that sounds harsh, but I want to concentrate on my talks, not try to explain to the tax department what all these invoices are about. 
- [] Keep me out of sponsorship discussions. I am at your event as Chris and to present. I will not "pay to play" and I won't speak at sponsored speaking slots. I am happy to provide you with contacts of who to invite instead. I am also happy to introduce you to company colleagues dealing with sponsorships, but this is not - at all - what I do. If you are looking for a corporate sponsoring to sell speaking slots, please don't contact me.
