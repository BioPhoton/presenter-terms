# presenter-terms
A no-nonsense explainer for conference organisers about my presenting terms and topics

I have defined speaker terms. In addition to the ones here, please refer to the "So you want me to talk?" article on my blog. I am a professional presenter with lots of experience. Therefore I want to make sure that there is no misconception about what I expect and deliver.
